						<p>With nearly forty years of executive experience, Irv Rothman is a renowned financial services expert with a track record of excellence. Whether engaging in start-ups, large mergers, joint venture and M&A activities, turnaround situations, or global operations, Irv’s Gutsball mentality has fueled his undeniable success and powerful execution.</p> 
						<p>As President and CEO of HP Financial Services, Irv leads over 1200 employees and oversees $12.5 billion in assets by championing a culture of trust, collaboration, autonomy, and ethical behavior that works to better serve their customers. </p>

A key leader in Compaq’s 1997 start-up, Irv built CFS into a global business across 43 countries, $3.4 billion in assets, and $1 billion in revenue through joint ventures, acquisitions, and creating new operations. In 2002, Rothman cemented his Gutsball ethos with his influence in the HP/Compaq merger, a deal that married Compaq’s global reach with HP’s technological prowess and resulted in a state-of-the-art finance and leasing company now worth over $3 billion in annual revenue. </p>
						<p>A Rutgers graduate with a MBA from Pepperdine University, Irv started his assent with leadership positions at U.S. Leasing International and Thomson McKinnon Securities before joining AT&amp;T in 1985.  As group president, Rothman built AT&T Capital into a $9 billion corporation.</p>
